    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This strawberry cake is easy to make from scratch with strawberry puree
      and strawberry gelatin. This recipe is worth its weight in gold to me as a
      caterer. I made this cake for a child's birthday party and it was a major
      hit! Frost with cream cheese frosting or chocolate ganache for a special
      treat.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar</strong>: This strawberry cake starts with two cups of
        white sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Butter</strong>: Cream the sugar with two sticks of softened
        butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jell-O</strong>: You'll need a 3-ounce package of
        strawberry-flavored Jell-O mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs</strong>: Four eggs add richness, moisture, and flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flour</strong>: This light and fluffy strawberry cake calls for
        cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which
        means it helps the cake rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Milk</strong>: Whole milk lends moisture to the homemade
        strawberry cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strawberries</strong>: Use frozen strawberries to make homemade
        strawberry pur√©e.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vanilla</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of
        the cake.
      </li>
    </ul>
